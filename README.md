# NAND_TICK


A 16-bit Serial CPU in NAND Logic

NAND TICK is one of a family of experimental bit-serial CPUs, intended for home construction from common parts.

It was designed as a follow-on to the earlier TICK, which was built from 74HCxx logic devices.

It began with the idea, that if a "ficticious" 16-bit universal shift  register (Parallel to Serial, and Serial to latching parallel) was available in a 40 pin DIL package, then this would greatly reduce the complexity and inventrory required to build a 16-bit bit-serial machine.

Such a device was created using H.Neemann's "Digital" simulator (here on Github) entirely using NAND gates. This means tht such a device could be built using whichever logic is available, be it 74HCxx, discrete DTL, LED-DTL, or discrete CMOS.

The device has both parallel inputs, and latching parallel outputs, plus serial in and out. It can therfore be used as an Accumulator, a general purpose register or a Program Counter. When fully populated with all functionality, it uses just less than 200, three-input NAND gates, mostly arranged as D-type flipflops.

As it mostly resembles a double length 74xx595, I have called it the KB595. A simpler version without the parallel latched outputs is the KB165, as it is similar to a double length 74xx165 PISO shift register.

Two other custom circuits are used in the design. The KB74 provides a clock-sequencer and timing pulse generator, consisting of a 4 bit counter and a chain of 4 flipflops. It is the equivalent of 53 NAND gates, mostly 3-input, but some 2 and 4 input too.

The last of the parts is called "Combo".  It consists of a bit-serial ALU, a half-adder incrementer circuit for the Program Counter and some instruction decoding logic. It is the equivalent of 62 NAND gates, a mix of 2, 3 inputs and some inverters.

A minimal design would typically be three of the shift registers, (Accumulator, B-Register and Program Counter), a KB74 clock sequencer and a Combo. Such a circuit would be approximately 700 transistors if using DTL or LED-DTL gates.

Any of these "chips"  can be opened - so the underlying logic and functionality can be inspected.

If converted to discrete LED DTL logic, using through-hole components the shift register would be about 340mm x100 mm.  DFF-24.jpg shows how one quarter of the basic KB165 register could be assembled on a 4-layer PCB (internal power and ground planes) with conventional through-hole components.

The Combo and the KB74 plus ROM and RAM would fit on a similar 240x100mm sized board. These could be rack mounted, using DIN41612 backplane connectors with a simple bus running between them.

The NAND_TICK_13 circuit is a half-way house to a working CPU.  

It requires the ROM to drive the instruction inputs on the Combo chip, and RAMs with read-write control logic to be added. 

This has been added in NAND_TICK_16, which can run a simple test program from ROM, allowing arithmetic operations and jumping.

It would probably be a good idea to provide an Input/Output register so that data can be passed in and out via SPI transfers. These additions would complete a working design in fewer than 1000 discrete transistors.
